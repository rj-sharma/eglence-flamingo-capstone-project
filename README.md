Coursera's Big data specialization Capstone project which i completed. I had so much fun completing the specialization.

A great specialization with a culminating final project in which I learned to build my own big data ecosystem using tools and methods (Hadoop with MapReduce, Spark, Pig, and Hive) learned throughout the course. It covers the data exploration and modeling of complex datasets using Splunk & Spark, advanced analytics using KNIME (decision tree classification), Spark's MLLib (clustering analysis) & Neo4j (graph analytics) and finally bringing it all together to create an engaging and compelling report and presentation. 

It is a easy and informative course to build your skillset in bigdata. I highly recommend to do it by youself.
